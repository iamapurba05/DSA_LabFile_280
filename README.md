# DSA Lab File – B.Tech CSE (Section B)

This repository contains my Data Structures & Algorithms lab work for K.R. Mangalam University.
It includes implementations of core DSA concepts in Python, C++, and Java, grouped by lab questions.

# Contents
Python Implementations

Stack operations

Reverse a string

Bracket balancing

Undo operations

Inventory Management (Insert, Search, Update, Delete)

Library Management using Linked List + Stack (Transactions)

Queue Insertion

Weather Record Storage using ADT

Linked List operations (Insert, Search, Display)

Circular Linked List operations

C++ Implementations

Binary Search

Bubble Sort

Circular Queue (Insertion/Deletion)

Java Implementations

(If added later) Additional DSA problems based on syllabus

How to Use

Each question’s code is self-contained.
Run the files individually based on language:

.py → Python 3

.cpp → g++ compiler

.java → javac + java runtime

# Purpose

This repo serves as:

A structured record of my DSA lab submissions

A reference for basic data structure implementations

A foundation for future DSA and coding interview prep
